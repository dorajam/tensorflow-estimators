# Tensorflow 101: End-to-end machine learning using Estimators

Supporting material used in a workshop created by [Dora Jambor](https://github.com/dorajam) and [Peng Yu](https://github.com/yupbank).

The workshop focused on the ease and simplicity of building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for production environments using Tensorflow's high-level estimators API.

In the notebook worksheet, we walk through this process by building an image classifier on the Fashion MNIST Dataset.
This dataset contains 60K training and 10K test images of clothing articles, each classified into 10 labels. Each image has been greyscaled and resized to 28x28 pixels. We use the Estimators API to train, evaluate, predict and export our model. 

Slides on the workshop will be soon available, covering more details on Tensorflow basics and Estimators.
